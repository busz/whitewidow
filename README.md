#Whitewidow

Whitewidow is an open source automated SQL vulnerability scanner, that is capable of running through a file list, or can
scrape Google for potential vulnerable websites. It allows automatic file formatting, random user agents, IP addresses,
server information, multiple SQL injection syntax, and a fun environment. This program was created for learning purposes,
and is intended to teach users what vulnerability looks like.

Although whitewidow is a completely open source project, and is completely free. Every once in awhile I need some coffee.
If you like this program, and like this idea, you can help me with my [coffee fund.](https://www.paypal.me/Perkins892)

#Download

Preferably clone repository, alternatively you can download zip and tarball [here](https://github.com/Ekultek/whitewidow/releases/tag/1.0.6.1)

For now download the zip or tar file, cloning the repository will not allow you to run the program.

#Usage

`ruby whitewidow.rb -h` Will print the help page

`ruby whitewidow.rb -e=<either default or file>` You will need to tell whitewidow which type of example you are looking
for, either default or file.

`ruby whitewidow.rb -f=<path/to/file>` Will run Whitewidow through a file, you will not need to provide whitewidow the
full path to the file, just provide it the paths within the whitewidow directory itself. Also you will not need a beginning
slash, example:

    - whitewidow.rb -f=tmp/sites.txt #<= CORRECT
    - whitewidow.rb -f=/home/users/me/whitewidow-1.0.6/tmp/sites.txt #<= INCORRECT

`ruby whitewidow.rb -d` Will run whitewidow in default mode and scrape Google using the search queries in the lib directory

`ruby whitewidow.rb -d --proxy=127.0.0.1:8080` Will run whitewidow in default mode using a proxy

`ruby whitewidow.rb -d --thread=5` Will run whitewidow in default mode using 5 different threads, meaning that it will
use 5 search queries on 5 search engines

`ruby whitewidow.rb -d --tor` Will run whitewidow in default mode through Tor on your localhost.
